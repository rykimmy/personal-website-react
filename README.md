# personal-website-react

Github username: rykimmy

## Description

This project is a personal website that I intend to use both as a coding project and as a personal resume. It includes an About, Education, Experience, Projects, and Activities & Interests section, highlighting important information about myself. This project uses React, HTML, and CSS.

The code is separated into various components responsible for each of the sections. About, Education, Experience, Projects, and Activities & Interests all have their individual folders that contain an item list, where each item represents an item from the section (e.g. a school I attended, a prior experience, etc), as well as code to map these items in a particular format and render them on the page. These are all put into the BodyContent. Additionally, the NavBar, ProfilePic, and Contacts are also separate components, and all of these are assembled in the main App.jsx file.

To run the code locally, `cd` into the directory and run `npm run dev`.
