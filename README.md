# personal-website-react

Github username: rykimmy

## Description

This project is a personal website that I intend to use both as a coding project and as a personal resume. It includes an About, Education, Experience, Projects, and Activities & Interests section, highlighting important information about myself. This project uses React, HTML, and CSS.

To run the code locally, `cd` into the directory and run `npm run dev`.

### Extra Comments

This is one of three projects that I used to learn React.
